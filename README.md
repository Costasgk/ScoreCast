# ScoreCast - Football Game Outcome Predictor

![ScoreCast Logo](ScoreCast.png)

**ScoreCast** is an open-source web application designed to predict the outcomes of football games in six minor football leagues: Serie A Brazil, Serie B Brazil, Primera Division Argentina, J1 League Japan, Eliteserien Norway, and Veikkausliiga Finland. Powered by a DecisionTreeClassifier model, ScoreCast provides users with insights into which team is likely to win or lose a match, aiding football enthusiasts and bettors in making informed decisions.

## Features

- Accurate Predictions: ScoreCast utilizes machine learning to analyze historical match data and make reliable predictions for upcoming games.
- User-friendly Interface: The intuitive web interface allows users to input match details and instantly receive outcome predictions.
- Multiple Leagues: Covering five minor football leagues, ScoreCast caters to fans and bettors interested in matches from Brazil, Argentina, Japan, Norway, and Finland.
- Ongoing Development: We believe in continuous improvement, and ScoreCast is an open-source project open to contributions from the community.

## How it Works

ScoreCast **scrapes data** from [FBREF](https://fbref.com/en/) to gather crucial information on team performance and player statistics. This data is then fed into a trained **DecisionTreeClassifier model**, which evaluates various factors to predict the likelihood of a win or loss for each team.

## Deployment

ScoreCast is deployed on Heroku, ensuring a seamless and reliable user experience. The app was developed using Flask, a lightweight and versatile web framework, allowing for efficient handling of predictions and smooth navigation.
