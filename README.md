# ScoreCast - Football Game Outcome Predictor

![ScoreCast Logo](ScoreCast.png)

**ScoreCast**  is an open-source web application designed to predict the outcomes of football games in twelve diverse football leagues, providing comprehensive coverage of the global football landscape. Our platform now includes predictions for some of the most popular and competitive leagues in Europe, such as the Premier League England, Serie A Italy, La Liga Spain, Ligue 1 France, Bundesliga Germany, and Super League Greece. Powered by a DecisionTreeClassifier model, ScoreCast provides users with valuable insights into which team is likely to win or lose a match, aiding football enthusiasts and bettors in making well-informed decisions for a wide range of matches across different continents and football cultures.

## Features

- Accurate Predictions: ScoreCast utilizes machine learning to analyze historical match data and make reliable predictions for upcoming games.
- User-friendly Interface: The intuitive web interface allows users to input match details and instantly receive outcome predictions.
- Multiple Leagues: ScoreCast now covers a broader range of football leagues, including top-tier leagues like the Premier League England, Serie A Italy, La Liga Spain, Ligue 1 France, Bundesliga Germany, and Super League Greece, in addition to the existing leagues from    Brazil, Argentina, Japan, Norway, and Finland.
- Ongoing Development: We believe in continuous improvement, and ScoreCast is an open-source project open to contributions from the community.

## How it Works

ScoreCast **scrapes data** from [FBREF](https://fbref.com/en/) to gather crucial information on team performance and player statistics. This data is then fed into a trained **DecisionTreeClassifier model**, which evaluates various factors to predict the likelihood of a win or loss for each team.

## Deployment

ScoreCast is deployed on AWS, ensuring a seamless and reliable user experience. The app was developed using Flask, a lightweight and versatile web framework, allowing for efficient handling of predictions and smooth navigation.
